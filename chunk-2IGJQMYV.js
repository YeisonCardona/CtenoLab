By focusing on <b>unilateral motor imagery</b>, the protocol aims to isolate specific <b>cortical activation patterns</b> that can be detected using <b>non-invasive brain recording techniques</b> such as <b>EEG</b>. These patterns are then used to evaluate the feasibility of <b>decoding motor intentions</b> for <b>brain-computer interface (BCI)</b> applications.",hypothesis:"We hypothesize that <b>unilateral motor imagery</b>\u2014specifically the imagined movement of a <b>single hand</b>\u2014produces <b>distinguishable</b> and <b>repeatable changes</b> in the <b>mu and beta frequency bands</b> over <b>sensorimotor cortex</b>.

Each trial begins with a <b>fixation cross</b> displayed at the center of the screen, followed by a <b>visual cue</b> (such as an arrow) indicating which hand the participant should imagine moving. The participant is instructed to <b>imagine performing the movement</b> (e.g., grasping or rotating the hand) <b>without any actual muscle contraction</b>. Each imagery period typically lasts between <b>4 to 6 seconds</b> and is followed by a <b>rest interval</b>. The protocol is repeated across <b>multiple trials</b> to ensure sufficient data for analysis.
