It is designed to evaluate the ability to generate <b>consistent</b> and <b>classifiable brain signals</b> through motor imagery alone. <b>Unilateral motor imagery</b> is widely used in <b>brain-computer interface (BCI) research</b> due to its simplicity, <b>well-defined cortical activation patterns</b>, and effectiveness in training <b>neural decoding algorithms</b>.",metadata:{type:"Unilateral",paradigm:"Endogenous",stimulus_type:"Visual",recording_modality:"EEG",difficulty_level:"Moderate",class_range:{min:2,max:4},intended_applications:["Sensorimotor Rehabilitation","Calibration of Binary BCI Systems","Assessment of Motor Cortex Functionality","Development of BCI-Controlled Prosthetics","Training for Motor Imagery Proficiency"],common_datasets:["BCI Competition III \u2013 Dataset IVa (Graz)","BCI Competition IV \u2013 Dataset 2a (Graz)","BNCI Horizon 2020 \u2013 Dataset 001-2014","OpenBMI \u2013 Motor Imagery Dataset","PhysioNet \u2013 EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset"]},objective:"The objective of this experiment is to assess the capacity to voluntarily modulate <b>sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs)</b> through the imagined movement of a <b>single limb</b>, typically the <b>left or right hand</b>. By isolating <b>unilateral motor imagery</b>, it becomes possible to identify <b>specific cortical activation patterns</b> using <b>non-invasive EEG</b> recordings. These patterns serve as the basis for evaluating the feasibility of <b>decoding motor intentions</b> in BCI applications.",hypothesis:"<b>Unilateral motor imagery</b> of a single hand is expected to produce <b>distinct and repeatable modulations</b> in the <b>mu and beta frequency bands</b> over the <b>contralateral sensorimotor cortex</b>. These changes are detectable via <b>EEG</b> and can be used to <b>classify mental states</b> associated with left or right hand motor imagery, facilitating the development of <b>accurate and robust BCI control strategies</b>.",procedure:"Participants are seated in a <b>controlled environment</b> and equipped with <b>EEG recording hardware</b>. Each trial begins with a <b>fixation cross</b> displayed at the center of the screen, followed by a <b>visual cue</b> (e.g., a directional arrow) indicating the limb to be imagined. The task involves <b>kinesthetic imagination</b> of movement (e.g., grasping or rotation) <b>without actual muscle contraction</b>. Each imagery period lasts <b>4 to 6 seconds</b>, followed by a <b>rest interval</b>. The protocol is repeated across <b>multiple trials</b> to ensure data sufficiency and reliability. The full session typically lasts <b>20 to 40 minutes</b>, depending on the number of blocks and conditions.",requirements:"The experiment requires a <b>modern web browser</b> capable of rendering visual stimuli with <b>precise timing</b> (e.g., Chrome or Firefox). For EEG-based setups, the system must support <b>synchronized stimulus presentation</b> and integration with <b>external acquisition hardware</b> via <b>serial, WebUSB</b>, or <b>network protocols</b>. Participants should be familiarized with <b>motor imagery strategies</b> and perform the task in a <b>quiet, distraction-free setting</b>. Optional enhancements include <b>real-time feedback</b> and <b>quality monitoring tools</b>.",characteristics:"This experiment is categorized as <b>endogenous</b> because it depends entirely on the participant\u2019s <b>internal cognitive processes</b>, specifically <b>voluntary motor imagery</b>.
