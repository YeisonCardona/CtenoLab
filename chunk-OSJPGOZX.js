It is valuable in exploring more complex motor representations within <b>BCI systems</b>.",metadata:{type:"Bilateral",paradigm:"Endogenous",stimulus_type:"Visual",recording_modality:"EEG",difficulty_level:"Advanced",class_range:{min:2,max:4}},objective:"The goal of this experiment is to assess the participant\u2019s ability to <b>simultaneously or sequentially imagine movements</b> of <b>both limbs</b>, thereby enabling the study of <b>distributed cortical activations</b> and <b>coordination-related EEG features</b>. This helps evaluate the feasibility of <b>multiclass BCI control</b> based on complex motor imagery patterns.",hypothesis:"<b>Bilateral motor imagery</b> is expected to induce <b>concurrent modulations</b> in the <b>mu and beta frequency bands</b> over <b>bilateral sensorimotor cortices</b>. These modulations reflect interhemispheric synchronization and coordination, providing a neural basis for <b>more complex intention decoding</b> in BCI systems.",procedure:"Participants are placed in a <b>controlled environment</b> and connected to <b>EEG acquisition hardware</b>. Each trial begins with a <b>fixation cross</b>, followed by a <b>visual cue</b> indicating the motor imagery task: <b>simultaneous bimanual movement</b> (e.g., both hands grasping) or <b>alternating motor tasks</b>. Participants are instructed to <b>imagine the action kinesthetically</b> without physical movement. Each trial consists of a <b>4 to 6 second imagery phase</b> and a <b>rest interval</b>.
