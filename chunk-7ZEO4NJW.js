  `});experiment={name:"Intentional Motor Imagery",description:"This experiment introduces a <b>two-stage task design</b> involving an <b>instruction phase</b> followed by a <b>delayed motor imagery execution</b>. Participants are first <b>informed of the upcoming task</b> and only later cued to <b>perform the imagery</b>, allowing separation of <b>expectation-related activity</b> from <b>intentional motor imagery execution</b>. This setup is valuable for analyzing <b>preparatory states</b> and the modulation of <b>sensorimotor rhythms</b> under controlled intention.",metadata:{type:"Intentional",paradigm:"Endogenous (with preparatory phase)",stimulus_type:"Visual",recording_modality:"EEG",difficulty_level:"Moderate",class_range:{min:2,max:4}},objective:"The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the participant's ability to <b>prepare</b> for and then <b>intentionally initiate motor imagery</b> following a preparatory cue. By temporally dissociating <b>anticipation</b> from <b>imagery execution</b>, researchers can better understand the <b>cognitive dynamics of intention</b> and their influence on <b>sensorimotor EEG patterns</b>.",hypothesis:"It is hypothesized that a <b>preparatory instruction phase</b> prior to motor imagery enhances <b>task-related cortical readiness</b> and results in more <b>reliable and temporally aligned modulations</b> of the <b>mu and beta frequency bands</b>. This structure may reveal <b>distinct anticipatory markers</b> preceding actual motor imagery onset, supporting the development of <b>intention-aware BCI models</b>.",procedure:'Each trial begins with a <b>fixation cross</b>, followed by a <b>text or icon-based instruction</b> indicating the imagery class (e.g., "Prepare: Left Hand"). After a <b>preparation period</b> (typically 2\u20133 seconds), a second <b>execution cue</b> (e.g., a beep or symbol flash) signals the participant to begin the <b>actual motor imagery</b>. The imagery phase lasts <b>4\u20136 seconds</b>, followed by a rest interval. EEG is recorded throughout, capturing both <b>anticipation</b> and <b>execution-related activity</b>. The full session consists of <b>multiple randomized trials</b> with controlled inter-stimulus intervals.',requirements:"The task requires a <b>modern browser</b> supporting <b>timed visual/audio stimuli</b>. EEG systems must ensure <b>precise time-locking</b> to both instruction and execution cues. Integration with <b>hardware triggers</b> is recommended to distinguish preparatory and execution phases. Participants should be <b>trained in maintaining attention</b> across the delay, and <b>feedback mechanisms</b> may be added to reinforce timing compliance.",characteristics:"This paradigm is <b>endogenous</b>, relying on <b>internally driven imagery</b>, but features an <b>intentional execution phase</b> temporally distinct from initial instruction. It is typically used with <b>unilateral imagery tasks</b>, allowing exploration of <b>intention formation</b>, <b>neural priming</b>, and <b>temporal decoding strategies</b> in EEG-based BCIs."};stimulusCommandMap={Right:["R","r"],Left:["L","l"],Up:["U","u"],Down:["D","d"],Rest:["R","r"," "]};formField=[{type:"checkbox",key:"classes",label:"Motor Imagery Classes",value:["Right","Left"],options:["Right","Left","Up","Down","Rest"],hint:"Select the classes to include in the experiment."},{type:"slider",key:"trials_per_class",label:"Trials per Class",value:20,min:1,max:100,step:1,suffix:" trials",hint:"Number of repetitions per selected class."},{type:"slider",key:"intentional_duration",label:"Intentional Phase Duration",value:2e3,min:100,max:1e4,step:100,suffix:" ms",hint:"Duration of the intentional control phase before stimulus appears."},{type:"slider",key:"stimulus_duration",label:"Stimulus Duration",value:4e3,min:100,max:1e4,step:100,suffix:" ms",hint:"Time each stimulus is visible during the trial."},{type:"range",key:"soa",label:"SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony)",value:[1e3,2e3],min:0,max:5e3,step:100,suffix:" ms",hint:"Time between stimuli, randomized between min and max."}];static \u0275fac=function(l){return new(l||r)(u($),u(B),u(P),u(Q),u(O),u(N))};static \u0275cmp=I({type:r,selectors:[["app-intentional"]],features:[E],decls:75,vars:19,consts:[["taskPanel",""],["tabGroup",""],["formComponent",""],[1,"no-margin-bottom"],[1,"align-justify",3,"innerHTML"],["dynamicHeight","","mat-stretch-tabs","",1,"example-stretched-tabs","mat-elevation-z4"],["label","Stimuli Delivery"],[1,"margin-bottom-small"],[3,"valueChange","config","columns","storageKey"],[1,"margin-top-large",3,"innerHTML"],[1,"flex-row","flex-row-left"],[1,"elipsis-96",3,"href"],["matIconButton","",3,"cdkCopyToClipboard"],["matButton","filled",1,"margin-top-large","margin-bottom-large",3,"click"],[3,"experimentConfig","embeded","stimulusCommandMap"],["label","Hardware Setup"],[1,"margin-top-large"],["mat-table","",3,"dataSource"],["matColumnDef","name"],["mat-header-cell","",4,"matHeaderCellDef"],["mat-cell","",4,"matCellDef"],["matColumnDef","value"],["matColumnDef","value2"],["mat-header-row","",4,"matHeaderRowDef"],["mat-row","",4,"matRowDef","matRowDefColumns"],["label","Experiment Context"],[3,"experiment"],["matFab","","extended","",1,"margin-top-large","button-configure","margin-bottom-medium","margin-left-small","mat-elevation-z1",3,"click"],["mat-header-cell",""],["mat-cell",""],["mat-header-row",""],["mat-row",""]],template:function(l,a){if(l&1){let p=T();i(0,"div",null,0)(2,"h1",3),t(3),n(),d(4,"p",4),i(5,"mat-tab-group",5,1)(7,"mat-tab",6),d(8,"div",7),i(9,"app-inputs",8,2),x("valueChange",function(c){return g(p),y(a.onFormValueChange(c))}),n(),d(11,"div",9),i(12,"p",10)(13,"span")(14,"b"),t(15,"Direct experiment link:"),n()(),i(16,"a",11),t(17),n(),i(18,"button",12)(19,"mat-icon"),t(20,"content_copy"),n()()(),i(21,"button",13),x("click",function(){return g(p),y(a.loadDefaultValues())}),t(22,"Load Default Values"),n(),d(23,"app-stimuli",14),n(),i(24,"mat-tab",15)(25,"h2",16),t(26,"Class Events for Neurofeedback Loop (EVT=KEY)"),n(),i(27,"p"),t(28," The commands listed below represent the "),i(29,"b"),t(30,"standard control classes"),n(),t(31," required to properly close the loop in "),i(32,"b"),t(33,"neurofeedback paradigms"),n(),t(34," or "),i(35,"b"),t(36,"inference-driven visual feedback experiments"),n(),t(37,".
