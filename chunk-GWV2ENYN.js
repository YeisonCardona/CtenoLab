  `});experiment={name:"Sequential Motor Imagery",description:"This experiment involves the <b>imagination of ordered motor sequences</b>, such as <b>grasping followed by rotating</b> or <b>extending followed by retracting</b>. Each trial presents a <b>temporally structured cue sequence</b>, allowing researchers to study <b>multi-phase motor planning</b> and the temporal dynamics of motor imagery. It supports <b>complex classification strategies</b> based on the segmentation of motor intentions over time.",metadata:{type:"Sequential",paradigm:"Endogenous",stimulus_type:"Visual",recording_modality:"EEG",difficulty_level:"Advanced",class_range:{min:2,max:6}},objective:"The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the ability of participants to <b>internally generate temporally structured motor imagery sequences</b>. By presenting <b>two or more sequential cues</b> in each trial, it is possible to <b>analyze EEG responses</b> associated with <b>each phase of the motor plan</b> and assess the feasibility of decoding <b>multi-step motor intentions</b>.",hypothesis:"Sequential motor imagery is expected to induce <b>phase-specific modulations</b> in the <b>mu and beta bands</b>, revealing <b>temporal segmentation</b> in cortical activity. These dynamics may provide a basis for <b>high-resolution decoding</b> of compound motor plans in BCI systems.",procedure:'Participants are equipped with <b>EEG acquisition hardware</b> and seated in a <b>quiet environment</b>. Each trial begins with a <b>fixation cross</b>, followed by a <b>series of visual cues</b> (e.g., "Grasp - Rotate") presented in succession, each lasting <b>2\u20134 seconds</b>. Participants are instructed to <b>imagine each action in the sequence</b> without physical movement. Trials include a <b>rest phase</b> between sequences. Multiple blocks ensure robustness across different class combinations.',requirements:"Requires a <b>modern web browser</b> with <b>timing-accurate visual rendering</b> and EEG hardware capable of <b>multi-event synchronization</b>.
