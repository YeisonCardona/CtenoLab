By grouping tasks in blocks, the design enables an analysis of <b>intra-class temporal stability</b> and potential changes in <b>neural engagement or fatigue</b> over time.",hypothesis:"<b>Blocked presentation</b> of motor imagery trials is expected to yield <b>more stable and stereotyped neural patterns</b> for each class, as compared to randomized sequences. However, repetition may also induce <b>habituation</b> or <b>declining attentional engagement</b>, which will be reflected in reduced EEG power changes over time within blocks.",procedure:"Participants are placed in a <b>quiet environment</b> and fitted with <b>EEG acquisition hardware</b>. Each block consists of <b>multiple trials</b> of the same motor imagery task (e.g., right-hand grasping). A <b>fixation cross</b> is presented, followed by a <b>visual instruction cue</b>. The participant performs <b>kinesthetic imagination</b> of the specified movement for <b>4 to 6 seconds</b>, followed by a rest period. After completing all trials in a block, a new class is introduced. The order of blocks is counterbalanced or fixed depending on the research design.",requirements:"This experiment requires a <b>modern browser</b> capable of high-precision timing and <b>visual stimulus rendering</b>. EEG setups must support <b>multi-class labeling</b> and <b>continuous acquisition</b>. Integration with hardware must occur via <b>WebUSB</b>, <b>serial</b>, or <b>network</b> protocols. Participants should be instructed in <b>motor imagery techniques</b> and allowed time for practice before the session. <b>Optional feedback or breaks</b> between blocks can be implemented to prevent mental fatigue.",characteristics:"This task is <b>endogenous</b>, driven by internal intention rather than external triggers.
