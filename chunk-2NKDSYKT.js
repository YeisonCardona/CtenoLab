By focusing on <b>unilateral motor imagery</b>, the protocol aims to isolate specific <b>cortical activation patterns</b> that can be detected using <b>non-invasive brain recording techniques</b> such as <b>EEG</b>. These patterns are then used to evaluate the feasibility of <b>decoding motor intentions</b> for <b>brain-computer interface (BCI)</b> applications.",hypothesis:"We hypothesize that <b>unilateral motor imagery</b>\u2014specifically the imagined movement of a <b>single hand</b>\u2014produces <b>distinguishable</b> and <b>repeatable changes</b> in the <b>mu and beta frequency bands</b> over <b>sensorimotor cortex</b>.

Each trial begins with a <b>fixation cross</b> displayed at the center of the screen, followed by a <b>visual cue</b> (such as an arrow) indicating which hand the participant should imagine moving. The participant is instructed to <b>imagine performing the movement</b> (e.g., grasping or rotating the hand) <b>without any actual muscle contraction</b>. Each imagery period typically lasts between <b>4 to 6 seconds</b> and is followed by a <b>rest interval</b>. The protocol is repeated across <b>multiple trials</b> to ensure sufficient data for analysis.

It is considered <b>unilateral</b> because only one limb (either the left or the right hand) is imagined per trial, allowing for <b>clearer separation</b> of cortical activation and <b>simplified classification</b> of motor intentions within brain-computer interface systems."};static \u0275fac=function(e){return new(e||a)(t(l),t(c))};static \u0275cmp=r({type:a,selectors:[["app-unilateral"]],decls:1,vars:1,consts:[[3,"experiment"]],template:function(e,p){e&1&&o(0,"app-experiment",0),e&2&&n("experiment",p.experiment)},dependencies:[s,b],encapsulation:2})};export{m as Unilateral};
