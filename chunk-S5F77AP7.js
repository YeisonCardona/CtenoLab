By presenting <b>two or more sequential cues</b> in each trial, it is possible to <b>analyze EEG responses</b> associated with <b>each phase of the motor plan</b> and assess the feasibility of decoding <b>multi-step motor intentions</b>.",hypothesis:"Sequential motor imagery is expected to induce <b>phase-specific modulations</b> in the <b>mu and beta bands</b>, revealing <b>temporal segmentation</b> in cortical activity.
