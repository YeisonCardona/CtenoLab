  `});experiment={name:"Blocked Motor Imagery",description:"This experiment explores the <b>mental rehearsal of movement</b> presented in <b>structured, homogeneous blocks</b> rather than random sequences. Each block consists of <b>repeated motor imagery trials</b> of a single class\u2014such as imagining only left-hand movement\u2014before transitioning to the next block. This <b>blocked presentation</b> facilitates the analysis of <b>within-class stability</b> and the impact of task repetition on <b>neural modulations</b> in EEG signals.",metadata:{type:"Blocked",paradigm:"Endogenous",stimulus_type:"Visual",recording_modality:"EEG",difficulty_level:"Moderate",class_range:{min:2,max:4}},objective:"The objective of this experiment is to investigate how <b>repeated trials of the same motor imagery class</b> affect the consistency and quality of <b>sensorimotor EEG signals</b>. By grouping tasks in blocks, the design enables an analysis of <b>intra-class temporal stability</b> and potential changes in <b>neural engagement or fatigue</b> over time.",hypothesis:"<b>Blocked presentation</b> of motor imagery trials is expected to yield <b>more stable and stereotyped neural patterns</b> for each class, as compared to randomized sequences. However, repetition may also induce <b>habituation</b> or <b>declining attentional engagement</b>, which will be reflected in reduced EEG power changes over time within blocks.",procedure:"Participants are placed in a <b>quiet environment</b> and fitted with <b>EEG acquisition hardware</b>. Each block consists of <b>multiple trials</b> of the same motor imagery task (e.g., right-hand grasping). A <b>fixation cross</b> is presented, followed by a <b>visual instruction cue</b>. The participant performs <b>kinesthetic imagination</b> of the specified movement for <b>4 to 6 seconds</b>, followed by a rest period. After completing all trials in a block, a new class is introduced. The order of blocks is counterbalanced or fixed depending on the research design.",requirements:"This experiment requires a <b>modern browser</b> capable of high-precision timing and <b>visual stimulus rendering</b>. EEG setups must support <b>multi-class labeling</b> and <b>continuous acquisition</b>. Integration with hardware must occur via <b>WebUSB</b>, <b>serial</b>, or <b>network</b> protocols. Participants should be instructed in <b>motor imagery techniques</b> and allowed time for practice before the session. <b>Optional feedback or breaks</b> between blocks can be implemented to prevent mental fatigue.",characteristics:"This task is <b>endogenous</b>, driven by internal intention rather than external triggers. It employs a <b>blocked design</b> to minimize cognitive switching and maximize signal repeatability, making it especially useful for <b>model calibration</b> and <b>early-stage BCI training</b> where signal reliability is critical."};formField=[{type:"checkbox",key:"classes",label:"Motor Imagery Classes",value:["Right","Left"],options:["Right","Left","Up","Down","Rest"],hint:"Select the classes to include in the experiment."},{type:"slider",key:"trials_per_class",label:"Trials per Class",value:20,min:1,max:100,step:1,suffix:" trials",hint:"Number of repetitions per selected class."},{type:"slider",key:"stimulus_duration",label:"Stimulus Duration",value:4e3,min:100,max:1e4,step:100,suffix:" ms",hint:"Time each stimulus is shown."},{type:"range",key:"soa",label:"SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony)",value:[1e3,2e3],min:0,max:5e3,step:100,suffix:" ms",hint:"Time between stimuli, randomized between min and max."}];static \u0275fac=function(i){return new(i||h)(c(E),c(I),c(q),c(O),c(j),c(V))};static \u0275cmp=v({type:h,selectors:[["app-blocked"]],features:[k],decls:30,vars:15,consts:[["taskPanel",""],["tabGroup",""],["formComponent",""],[1,"no-margin-bottom"],[1,"align-justify",3,"innerHTML"],["dynamicHeight","","mat-stretch-tabs","",1,"example-stretched-tabs","mat-elevation-z4"],["label","Stimuli Delivery"],[3,"valueChange","config","columns","storageKey"],[1,"margin-top-large",3,"innerHTML"],[1,"flex-row","flex-row-left"],[1,"elipsis-96",3,"href"],["matIconButton","",3,"cdkCopyToClipboard"],["matButton","filled",1,"margin-top-large","margin-bottom-large",3,"click"],[3,"experimentConfig","embeded"],["label","Experiment Context"],[1,"margin-top-large"],[3,"experiment"],["matFab","","extended","",1,"margin-top-large","button-configure","margin-bottom-medium","margin-left-small","mat-elevation-z1",3,"click"]],template:function(i,t){if(i&1){let l=x();r(0,"div",null,0)(2,"h1",3),s(3),n(),u(4,"p",4),r(5,"mat-tab-group",5,1)(7,"mat-tab",6)(8,"app-inputs",7,2),g("valueChange",function(m){return d(l),b(t.onFormValueChange(m))}),n(),u(10,"div",8),r(11,"p",9)(12,"span")(13,"b"),s(14,"Direct experiment link:"),n()(),r(15,"a",10),s(16),n(),r(17,"button",11)(18,"mat-icon"),s(19,"content_copy"),n()()(),r(20,"button",12),g("click",function(){return d(l),b(t.loadDefaultValues())}),s(21,"Load Default Values"),n(),u(22,"app-stimuli",13),n(),r(23,"mat-tab",14),u(24,"div",15)(25,"app-experiment",16),r(26,"button",17),g("click",function(){d(l);let m=w(6);return b(m.selectedIndex=1)}),r(27,"mat-icon"),s(28,"build"),n(),s(29," Configure this experiment "),n()()()()}i&2&&(a(3),S(t.experiment.name),a(),o("innerHTML",t.experiment.description,f),a(4),o("config",t.formField)("columns",t.columns)("storageKey",t.storageKey),a(2),o("innerHTML",t.summary(),f),a(5),o("href",M("",t.currentUrl,"",t.getFullWindowLink("/stimuli")),y),a(),_(" ",t.currentUrl,"",t.getFullWindowLink("/stimuli")," "),a(),o("cdkCopyToClipboard",t.currentUrl+t.getFullWindowLink("/stimuli")),a(5),o("experimentConfig",t.formData())("embeded","embeded"),a(3),o("experiment",t.experiment))},dependencies:[C,z,$,H,R,F,L,G,A,D,B,K,U,N],encapsulation:2})};export{P as MotorImageryBlocked};
