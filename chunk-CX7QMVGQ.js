  `});experiment={name:"Intentional Motor Imagery",description:"This experiment introduces a <b>two-stage task design</b> involving an <b>instruction phase</b> followed by a <b>delayed motor imagery execution</b>. Participants are first <b>informed of the upcoming task</b> and only later cued to <b>perform the imagery</b>, allowing separation of <b>expectation-related activity</b> from <b>intentional motor imagery execution</b>. This setup is valuable for analyzing <b>preparatory states</b> and the modulation of <b>sensorimotor rhythms</b> under controlled intention.",metadata:{type:"Intentional",paradigm:"Endogenous (with preparatory phase)",stimulus_type:"Visual",recording_modality:"EEG",difficulty_level:"Moderate",class_range:{min:2,max:4}},objective:"The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the participant's ability to <b>prepare</b> for and then <b>intentionally initiate motor imagery</b> following a preparatory cue. By temporally dissociating <b>anticipation</b> from <b>imagery execution</b>, researchers can better understand the <b>cognitive dynamics of intention</b> and their influence on <b>sensorimotor EEG patterns</b>.",hypothesis:"It is hypothesized that a <b>preparatory instruction phase</b> prior to motor imagery enhances <b>task-related cortical readiness</b> and results in more <b>reliable and temporally aligned modulations</b> of the <b>mu and beta frequency bands</b>. This structure may reveal <b>distinct anticipatory markers</b> preceding actual motor imagery onset, supporting the development of <b>intention-aware BCI models</b>.",procedure:'Each trial begins with a <b>fixation cross</b>, followed by a <b>text or icon-based instruction</b> indicating the imagery class (e.g., "Prepare: Left Hand"). After a <b>preparation period</b> (typically 2\u20133 seconds), a second <b>execution cue</b> (e.g., a beep or symbol flash) signals the participant to begin the <b>actual motor imagery</b>. The imagery phase lasts <b>4\u20136 seconds</b>, followed by a rest interval. EEG is recorded throughout, capturing both <b>anticipation</b> and <b>execution-related activity</b>. The full session consists of <b>multiple randomized trials</b> with controlled inter-stimulus intervals.',requirements:"The task requires a <b>modern browser</b> supporting <b>timed visual/audio stimuli</b>. EEG systems must ensure <b>precise time-locking</b> to both instruction and execution cues. Integration with <b>hardware triggers</b> is recommended to distinguish preparatory and execution phases. Participants should be <b>trained in maintaining attention</b> across the delay, and <b>feedback mechanisms</b> may be added to reinforce timing compliance.",characteristics:"This paradigm is <b>endogenous</b>, relying on <b>internally driven imagery</b>, but features an <b>intentional execution phase</b> temporally distinct from initial instruction. It is typically used with <b>unilateral imagery tasks</b>, allowing exploration of <b>intention formation</b>, <b>neural priming</b>, and <b>temporal decoding strategies</b> in EEG-based BCIs."};formField=[{type:"checkbox",key:"classes",label:"Motor Imagery Classes",value:["Right","Left"],options:["Right","Left","Up","Down","Rest"],hint:"Select the classes to include in the experiment."},{type:"slider",key:"trials_per_class",label:"Trials per Class",value:20,min:1,max:100,step:1,suffix:" trials",hint:"Number of repetitions per selected class."},{type:"slider",key:"intentional_duration",label:"Intentional Phase Duration",value:2e3,min:100,max:1e4,step:100,suffix:" ms",hint:"Duration of the intentional control phase before stimulus appears."},{type:"slider",key:"stimulus_duration",label:"Stimulus Duration",value:4e3,min:100,max:1e4,step:100,suffix:" ms",hint:"Time each stimulus is visible during the trial."},{type:"range",key:"soa",label:"SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony)",value:[1e3,2e3],min:0,max:5e3,step:100,suffix:" ms",hint:"Time between stimuli, randomized between min and max."}];static \u0275fac=function(i){return new(i||y)(p(C),p(E),p($),p(P),p(j),p(V))};static \u0275cmp=v({type:y,selectors:[["app-intentional"]],features:[x],decls:30,vars:15,consts:[["taskPanel",""],["tabGroup",""],["formComponent",""],[1,"no-margin-bottom"],[1,"align-justify",3,"innerHTML"],["dynamicHeight","","mat-stretch-tabs","",1,"example-stretched-tabs","mat-elevation-z4"],["label","Stimuli Delivery"],[3,"valueChange","config","columns","storageKey"],[1,"margin-top-large",3,"innerHTML"],[1,"flex-row","flex-row-left"],[1,"elipsis-96",3,"href"],["matIconButton","",3,"cdkCopyToClipboard"],["matButton","filled",1,"margin-top-large","margin-bottom-large",3,"click"],[3,"experimentConfig","embeded"],["label","Experiment Context"],[1,"margin-top-large"],[3,"experiment"],["matFab","","extended","",1,"margin-top-large","button-configure","margin-bottom-medium","margin-left-small","mat-elevation-z1",3,"click"]],template:function(i,t){if(i&1){let l=I();n(0,"div",null,0)(2,"h1",3),s(3),r(),c(4,"p",4),n(5,"mat-tab-group",5,1)(7,"mat-tab",6)(8,"app-inputs",7,2),g("valueChange",function(m){return d(l),b(t.onFormValueChange(m))}),r(),c(10,"div",8),n(11,"p",9)(12,"span")(13,"b"),s(14,"Direct experiment link:"),r()(),n(15,"a",10),s(16),r(),n(17,"button",11)(18,"mat-icon"),s(19,"content_copy"),r()()(),n(20,"button",12),g("click",function(){return d(l),b(t.loadDefaultValues())}),s(21,"Load Default Values"),r(),c(22,"app-stimuli",13),r(),n(23,"mat-tab",14),c(24,"div",15)(25,"app-experiment",16),n(26,"button",17),g("click",function(){d(l);let m=_(6);return b(m.selectedIndex=1)}),n(27,"mat-icon"),s(28,"build"),r(),s(29," Configure this experiment "),r()()()()}i&2&&(a(3),w(t.experiment.name),a(),o("innerHTML",t.experiment.description,f),a(4),o("config",t.formField)("columns",t.columns)("storageKey",t.storageKey),a(2),o("innerHTML",t.summary(),f),a(5),o("href",M("",t.currentUrl,"",t.getFullWindowLink("/stimuli")),h),a(),S(" ",t.currentUrl,"",t.getFullWindowLink("/stimuli")," "),a(),o("cdkCopyToClipboard",t.currentUrl+t.getFullWindowLink("/stimuli")),a(5),o("experimentConfig",t.formData())("embeded","embeded"),a(3),o("experiment",t.experiment))},dependencies:[k,G,z,H,R,L,A,O,B,F,D,K,q,N],encapsulation:2})};export{W as MotorImageryIntentional};
