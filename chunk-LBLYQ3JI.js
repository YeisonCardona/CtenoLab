  `});experiment={name:"Word-Cued Motor Imagery",description:'This experiment presents <b>motor imagery instructions</b> as <b>textual cues</b> (e.g., "LEFT HAND", "RIGHT FOOT") instead of symbols or arrows. The use of <b>semantic stimuli</b> enables analysis of <b>language-mediated motor preparation</b> and may enhance task clarity and cognitive focus. It is particularly useful in evaluating how <b>explicit verbal labeling</b> of movement intention modulates neural activation.',metadata:{type:"Unilateral",paradigm:"Endogenous",stimulus_type:"Textual",recording_modality:"EEG",difficulty_level:"Easy",class_range:{min:2,max:6}},objective:"The objective is to examine the brain\u2019s response to <b>word-based task instructions</b> and evaluate whether <b>semantic interpretation</b> of motor imagery cues influences <b>sensorimotor activation patterns</b>. This variant also allows for the study of <b>language-motor interaction</b> in BCI contexts.",hypothesis:"<b>Word-cued motor imagery</b> is expected to activate <b>both sensorimotor and language-processing regions</b>, producing distinct neural signatures that may enhance or modulate typical <b>mu and beta desynchronization</b>. Semantic clarity could improve classification accuracy and user comprehension.",procedure:'Participants are seated in front of a <b>monitor</b> and fitted with <b>EEG acquisition hardware</b>. Each trial begins with a <b>fixation cross</b>, followed by a <b>textual cue</b> displaying the motor imagery class (e.g., "RIGHT HAND"). Participants are instructed to <b>kinesthetically imagine the movement</b> described by the word for <b>4 to 6 seconds</b>. Afterward, a <b>rest period</b> is introduced.
