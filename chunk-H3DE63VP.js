  `});experiment={name:"Bilateral Motor Imagery",description:"This experiment investigates the <b>mental rehearsal of coordinated or alternating movements</b> involving <b>both limbs</b>, typically the left and right hands. By engaging <b>bilateral motor imagery</b>, it enables the analysis of <b>interhemispheric communication</b>, <b>motor coordination patterns</b>, and <b>distributed cortical activation</b>. It is valuable in exploring more complex motor representations within <b>BCI systems</b>.",metadata:{type:"Bilateral",paradigm:"Endogenous",stimulus_type:"Visual",recording_modality:"EEG",difficulty_level:"Advanced",class_range:{min:2,max:4}},objective:"The goal of this experiment is to assess the participant\u2019s ability to <b>simultaneously or sequentially imagine movements</b> of <b>both limbs</b>, thereby enabling the study of <b>distributed cortical activations</b> and <b>coordination-related EEG features</b>. This helps evaluate the feasibility of <b>multiclass BCI control</b> based on complex motor imagery patterns.",hypothesis:"<b>Bilateral motor imagery</b> is expected to induce <b>concurrent modulations</b> in the <b>mu and beta frequency bands</b> over <b>bilateral sensorimotor cortices</b>. These modulations reflect interhemispheric synchronization and coordination, providing a neural basis for <b>more complex intention decoding</b> in BCI systems.",procedure:"Participants are placed in a <b>controlled environment</b> and connected to <b>EEG acquisition hardware</b>. Each trial begins with a <b>fixation cross</b>, followed by a <b>visual cue</b> indicating the motor imagery task: <b>simultaneous bimanual movement</b> (e.g., both hands grasping) or <b>alternating motor tasks</b>. Participants are instructed to <b>imagine the action kinesthetically</b> without physical movement. Each trial consists of a <b>4 to 6 second imagery phase</b> and a <b>rest interval</b>. Multiple blocks are used to capture variability and ensure robust feature extraction.",requirements:"This experiment requires a <b>modern web browser</b> with high-precision visual rendering. EEG configurations must support <b>bilateral electrode coverage</b> and be compatible with <b>stimulus synchronization</b> through <b>WebUSB, serial, or network</b> protocols. Participants should have prior experience with <b>motor imagery tasks</b> and be instructed in <b>bimanual coordination</b> strategies. Quiet conditions and stable attention are critical. <b>Optional feedback mechanisms</b> may be integrated for training purposes.",characteristics:"Categorized as <b>endogenous</b>, this experiment depends on <b>internally generated motor imagery</b> involving <b>both limbs</b>.
