  `});experiment={name:"Blocked Motor Imagery",description:"This experiment explores the <b>mental rehearsal of movement</b> presented in <b>structured, homogeneous blocks</b> rather than random sequences. Each block consists of <b>repeated motor imagery trials</b> of a single class\u2014such as imagining only left-hand movement\u2014before transitioning to the next block. This <b>blocked presentation</b> facilitates the analysis of <b>within-class stability</b> and the impact of task repetition on <b>neural modulations</b> in EEG signals.",metadata:{type:"Blocked",paradigm:"Endogenous",stimulus_type:"Visual",recording_modality:"EEG",difficulty_level:"Moderate",class_range:{min:2,max:4}},objective:"The objective of this experiment is to investigate how <b>repeated trials of the same motor imagery class</b> affect the consistency and quality of <b>sensorimotor EEG signals</b>. By grouping tasks in blocks, the design enables an analysis of <b>intra-class temporal stability</b> and potential changes in <b>neural engagement or fatigue</b> over time.",hypothesis:"<b>Blocked presentation</b> of motor imagery trials is expected to yield <b>more stable and stereotyped neural patterns</b> for each class, as compared to randomized sequences. However, repetition may also induce <b>habituation</b> or <b>declining attentional engagement</b>, which will be reflected in reduced EEG power changes over time within blocks.",procedure:"Participants are placed in a <b>quiet environment</b> and fitted with <b>EEG acquisition hardware</b>. Each block consists of <b>multiple trials</b> of the same motor imagery task (e.g., right-hand grasping). A <b>fixation cross</b> is presented, followed by a <b>visual instruction cue</b>. The participant performs <b>kinesthetic imagination</b> of the specified movement for <b>4 to 6 seconds</b>, followed by a rest period. After completing all trials in a block, a new class is introduced. The order of blocks is counterbalanced or fixed depending on the research design.",requirements:"This experiment requires a <b>modern browser</b> capable of high-precision timing and <b>visual stimulus rendering</b>. EEG setups must support <b>multi-class labeling</b> and <b>continuous acquisition</b>. Integration with hardware must occur via <b>WebUSB</b>, <b>serial</b>, or <b>network</b> protocols. Participants should be instructed in <b>motor imagery techniques</b> and allowed time for practice before the session. <b>Optional feedback or breaks</b> between blocks can be implemented to prevent mental fatigue.",characteristics:"This task is <b>endogenous</b>, driven by internal intention rather than external triggers. It employs a <b>blocked design</b> to minimize cognitive switching and maximize signal repeatability, making it especially useful for <b>model calibration</b> and <b>early-stage BCI training</b> where signal reliability is critical."};stimulusCommandMap={Right:["R","r"],Left:["L","l"],Up:["U","u"],Down:["D","d"],Rest:["R","r"," "]};formField=[{type:"checkbox",key:"classes",label:"Motor Imagery Classes",value:["Right","Left"],options:["Right","Left","Up","Down","Rest"],hint:"Select the classes to include in the experiment."},{type:"slider",key:"trials_per_class",label:"Trials per Class",value:20,min:1,max:100,step:1,suffix:" trials",hint:"Number of repetitions per selected class."},{type:"slider",key:"stimulus_duration",label:"Stimulus Duration",value:4e3,min:100,max:1e4,step:100,suffix:" ms",hint:"Time each stimulus is shown."},{type:"range",key:"soa",label:"SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony)",value:[1e3,2e3],min:0,max:5e3,step:100,suffix:" ms",hint:"Time between stimuli, randomized between min and max."}];static \u0275fac=function(l){return new(l||r)(u(V),u(A),u(U),u(Q),u(O),u(K))};static \u0275cmp=E({type:r,selectors:[["app-blocked"]],features:[C],decls:75,vars:19,consts:[["taskPanel",""],["tabGroup",""],["formComponent",""],[1,"no-margin-bottom"],[1,"align-justify",3,"innerHTML"],["dynamicHeight","","mat-stretch-tabs","",1,"example-stretched-tabs","mat-elevation-z4"],["label","Stimuli Delivery"],[1,"margin-bottom-small"],[3,"valueChange","config","columns","storageKey"],[1,"margin-top-large",3,"innerHTML"],[1,"flex-row","flex-row-left"],[1,"elipsis-96",3,"href"],["matIconButton","",3,"cdkCopyToClipboard"],["matButton","filled",1,"margin-top-large","margin-bottom-large",3,"click"],[3,"experimentConfig","embeded","stimulusCommandMap"],["label","Hardware Setup"],[1,"margin-top-large"],["mat-table","",3,"dataSource"],["matColumnDef","name"],["mat-header-cell","",4,"matHeaderCellDef"],["mat-cell","",4,"matCellDef"],["matColumnDef","value"],["matColumnDef","value2"],["mat-header-row","",4,"matHeaderRowDef"],["mat-row","",4,"matRowDef","matRowDefColumns"],["label","Experiment Context"],[3,"experiment"],["matFab","","extended","",1,"margin-top-large","button-configure","margin-bottom-medium","margin-left-small","mat-elevation-z1",3,"click"],["mat-header-cell",""],["mat-cell",""],["mat-header-row",""],["mat-row",""]],template:function(l,n){if(l&1){let d=T();i(0,"div",null,0)(2,"h1",3),e(3),a(),c(4,"p",4),i(5,"mat-tab-group",5,1)(7,"mat-tab",6),c(8,"div",7),i(9,"app-inputs",8,2),x("valueChange",function(p){return g(d),h(n.onFormValueChange(p))}),a(),c(11,"div",9),i(12,"p",10)(13,"span")(14,"b"),e(15,"Direct experiment link:"),a()(),i(16,"a",11),e(17),a(),i(18,"button",12)(19,"mat-icon"),e(20,"content_copy"),a()()(),i(21,"button",13),x("click",function(){return g(d),h(n.loadDefaultValues())}),e(22,"Load Default Values"),a(),c(23,"app-stimuli",14),a(),i(24,"mat-tab",15)(25,"h2",16),e(26,"Class Events for Neurofeedback Loop (EVT=KEY)"),a(),i(27,"p"),e(28," The commands listed below represent the "),i(29,"b"),e(30,"standard control classes"),a(),e(31," required to properly close the loop in "),i(32,"b"),e(33,"neurofeedback paradigms"),a(),e(34," or "),i(35,"b"),e(36,"inference-driven visual feedback experiments"),a(),e(37,".
