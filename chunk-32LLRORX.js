  `});experiment={name:"Unilateral Motor Imagery",description:"This experiment focuses on the <b>mental rehearsal of movement</b> involving a <b>single limb</b>\u2014typically the left or right hand\u2014without any actual muscular activity. It is designed to evaluate the ability to generate <b>consistent</b> and <b>classifiable brain signals</b> through motor imagery alone. <b>Unilateral motor imagery</b> is widely used in <b>brain-computer interface (BCI) research</b> due to its simplicity, <b>well-defined cortical activation patterns</b>, and effectiveness in training <b>neural decoding algorithms</b>.",metadata:{type:"Unilateral",paradigm:"Endogenous",stimulus_type:"Visual",recording_modality:"EEG",difficulty_level:"Moderate",class_range:{min:2,max:4}},objective:"The objective of this experiment is to assess the capacity to voluntarily modulate <b>sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs)</b> through the imagined movement of a <b>single limb</b>, typically the <b>left or right hand</b>. By isolating <b>unilateral motor imagery</b>, it becomes possible to identify <b>specific cortical activation patterns</b> using <b>non-invasive EEG</b> recordings. These patterns serve as the basis for evaluating the feasibility of <b>decoding motor intentions</b> in BCI applications.",hypothesis:"<b>Unilateral motor imagery</b> of a single hand is expected to produce <b>distinct and repeatable modulations</b> in the <b>mu and beta frequency bands</b> over the <b>contralateral sensorimotor cortex</b>. These changes are detectable via <b>EEG</b> and can be used to <b>classify mental states</b> associated with left or right hand motor imagery, facilitating the development of <b>accurate and robust BCI control strategies</b>.",procedure:"Participants are seated in a <b>controlled environment</b> and equipped with <b>EEG recording hardware</b>. Each trial begins with a <b>fixation cross</b> displayed at the center of the screen, followed by a <b>visual cue</b> (e.g., a directional arrow) indicating the limb to be imagined. The task involves <b>kinesthetic imagination</b> of movement (e.g., grasping or rotation) <b>without actual muscle contraction</b>. Each imagery period lasts <b>4 to 6 seconds</b>, followed by a <b>rest interval</b>. The protocol is repeated across <b>multiple trials</b> to ensure data sufficiency and reliability. The full session typically lasts <b>20 to 40 minutes</b>, depending on the number of blocks and conditions.",requirements:"The experiment requires a <b>modern web browser</b> capable of rendering visual stimuli with <b>precise timing</b> (e.g., Chrome or Firefox). For EEG-based setups, the system must support <b>synchronized stimulus presentation</b> and integration with <b>external acquisition hardware</b> via <b>serial, WebUSB</b>, or <b>network protocols</b>. Participants should be familiarized with <b>motor imagery strategies</b> and perform the task in a <b>quiet, distraction-free setting</b>. Optional enhancements include <b>real-time feedback</b> and <b>quality monitoring tools</b>.",characteristics:"This experiment is categorized as <b>endogenous</b> because it depends entirely on the participant\u2019s <b>internal cognitive processes</b>, specifically <b>voluntary motor imagery</b>. It is also defined as <b>unilateral</b>, since each trial involves the imagination of a movement involving only one limb, enabling <b>clear separation of cortical activation patterns</b> and simplified classification for BCI systems."};stimulusCommandMap={Right:["R","r"],Left:["L","l"],Up:["U","u"],Down:["D","d"],Rest:["S","s"]};formField=[{type:"checkbox",key:"classes",label:"Motor Imagery Classes",value:["Right","Left"],options:["Right","Left","Up","Down","Rest"],hint:"Select the classes to include in the experiment."},{type:"slider",key:"trials_per_class",label:"Trials per Class",value:20,min:1,max:100,step:1,suffix:" trials",hint:"Number of repetitions per selected class."},{type:"slider",key:"stimulus_duration",label:"Stimulus Duration",value:4e3,min:100,max:1e4,step:100,suffix:" ms",hint:"Time each stimulus is shown."},{type:"range",key:"soa",label:"SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony)",value:[1e3,2e3],min:0,max:5e3,step:100,suffix:" ms",hint:"Time between stimuli, randomized between min and max."}];static \u0275fac=function(m){return new(m||a)(c($),c(F),c(O),c(Z),c(P),c(Y),c(G))};static \u0275cmp=D({type:a,selectors:[["app-unilateral"]],features:[k],decls:126,vars:19,consts:[["taskPanel",""],["tabGroup",""],["formComponent",""],[1,"no-margin-bottom"],[1,"align-justify",3,"innerHTML"],["dynamicHeight","","mat-stretch-tabs","",1,"example-stretched-tabs","mat-elevation-z4"],["label","Stimuli Delivery"],[1,"margin-bottom-small"],[3,"valueChange","config","columns","storageKey"],[1,"margin-top-large",3,"innerHTML"],[1,"flex-row","flex-row-left"],[1,"elipsis-96",3,"href"],["matIconButton","",3,"cdkCopyToClipboard"],["matButton","filled",1,"margin-top-large","margin-bottom-large",3,"click"],[3,"experimentConfig","embeded","stimulusCommandMap"],["label","Hardware Setup"],[1,"margin-top-large"],["mat-table","",3,"dataSource"],["matColumnDef","name"],["mat-header-cell","",4,"matHeaderCellDef"],["mat-cell","",4,"matCellDef"],["matColumnDef","value"],["matColumnDef","value2"],["matColumnDef","value3"],["matColumnDef","value4"],["mat-header-row","",4,"matHeaderRowDef"],["mat-row","",4,"matRowDef","matRowDefColumns"],["label","Experiment Context"],[3,"experiment"],["matFab","","extended","",1,"margin-top-large","button-configure","margin-bottom-medium","margin-left-small","mat-elevation-z1",3,"click"],["mat-header-cell",""],["mat-cell",""],["mat-header-row",""],["mat-row",""]],template:function(m,r){if(m&1){let p=U();t(0,"div",null,0)(2,"h1",3),e(3),i(),d(4,"p",4),t(5,"mat-tab-group",5,1)(7,"mat-tab",6),d(8,"div",7),t(9,"app-inputs",8,2),C("valueChange",function(u){return x(p),S(r.onFormValueChange(u))}),i(),d(11,"div",9),t(12,"p",10)(13,"span")(14,"b"),e(15,"Direct experiment link:"),i()(),t(16,"a",11),e(17),i(),t(18,"button",12)(19,"mat-icon"),e(20,"content_copy"),i()()(),t(21,"button",13),C("click",function(){return x(p),S(r.loadDefaultValues())}),e(22,"Load Default Values"),i(),d(23,"app-stimuli",14),i(),t(24,"mat-tab",15)(25,"h2",16),e(26,"Class Events for Neurofeedback Loop (EVT=KEY)"),i(),t(27,"p"),e(28," The commands listed below represent the "),t(29,"b"),e(30,"standard control classes"),i(),e(31," required to properly close the loop in "),t(32,"b"),e(33,"neurofeedback paradigms"),i(),e(34," or "),t(35,"b"),e(36,"inference-driven visual feedback experiments"),i(),e(37,".
