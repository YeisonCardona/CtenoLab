  `});experiment={name:"Intentional Motor Imagery",description:"This experiment introduces a <b>two-stage task design</b> involving an <b>instruction phase</b> followed by a <b>delayed motor imagery execution</b>. Participants are first <b>informed of the upcoming task</b> and only later cued to <b>perform the imagery</b>, allowing separation of <b>expectation-related activity</b> from <b>intentional motor imagery execution</b>. This setup is valuable for analyzing <b>preparatory states</b> and the modulation of <b>sensorimotor rhythms</b> under controlled intention.",metadata:{type:"Intentional",paradigm:"Endogenous (with preparatory phase)",stimulus_type:"Visual",recording_modality:"EEG",difficulty_level:"Moderate",class_range:{min:2,max:4}},objective:"The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the participant's ability to <b>prepare</b> for and then <b>intentionally initiate motor imagery</b> following a preparatory cue. By temporally dissociating <b>anticipation</b> from <b>imagery execution</b>, researchers can better understand the <b>cognitive dynamics of intention</b> and their influence on <b>sensorimotor EEG patterns</b>.",hypothesis:"It is hypothesized that a <b>preparatory instruction phase</b> prior to motor imagery enhances <b>task-related cortical readiness</b> and results in more <b>reliable and temporally aligned modulations</b> of the <b>mu and beta frequency bands</b>. This structure may reveal <b>distinct anticipatory markers</b> preceding actual motor imagery onset, supporting the development of <b>intention-aware BCI models</b>.",procedure:'Each trial begins with a <b>fixation cross</b>, followed by a <b>text or icon-based instruction</b> indicating the imagery class (e.g., "Prepare: Left Hand"). After a <b>preparation period</b> (typically 2\u20133 seconds), a second <b>execution cue</b> (e.g., a beep or symbol flash) signals the participant to begin the <b>actual motor imagery</b>. The imagery phase lasts <b>4\u20136 seconds</b>, followed by a rest interval. EEG is recorded throughout, capturing both <b>anticipation</b> and <b>execution-related activity</b>. The full session consists of <b>multiple randomized trials</b> with controlled inter-stimulus intervals.',requirements:"The task requires a <b>modern browser</b> supporting <b>timed visual/audio stimuli</b>. EEG systems must ensure <b>precise time-locking</b> to both instruction and execution cues. Integration with <b>hardware triggers</b> is recommended to distinguish preparatory and execution phases. Participants should be <b>trained in maintaining attention</b> across the delay, and <b>feedback mechanisms</b> may be added to reinforce timing compliance.",characteristics:"This paradigm is <b>endogenous</b>, relying on <b>internally driven imagery</b>, but features an <b>intentional execution phase</b> temporally distinct from initial instruction.
