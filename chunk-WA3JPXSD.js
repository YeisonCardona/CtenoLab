  `});experiment={name:"Blocked Motor Imagery",description:"This experiment explores the <b>mental rehearsal of movement</b> presented in <b>structured, homogeneous blocks</b> rather than random sequences. Each block consists of <b>repeated motor imagery trials</b> of a single class\u2014such as imagining only left-hand movement\u2014before transitioning to the next block. This <b>blocked presentation</b> facilitates the analysis of <b>within-class stability</b> and the impact of task repetition on <b>neural modulations</b> in EEG signals.",metadata:{type:"Blocked",paradigm:"Endogenous",stimulus_type:"Visual",recording_modality:"EEG",difficulty_level:"Moderate",class_range:{min:2,max:4}},objective:"The objective of this experiment is to investigate how <b>repeated trials of the same motor imagery class</b> affect the consistency and quality of <b>sensorimotor EEG signals</b>. By grouping tasks in blocks, the design enables an analysis of <b>intra-class temporal stability</b> and potential changes in <b>neural engagement or fatigue</b> over time.",hypothesis:"<b>Blocked presentation</b> of motor imagery trials is expected to yield <b>more stable and stereotyped neural patterns</b> for each class, as compared to randomized sequences. However, repetition may also induce <b>habituation</b> or <b>declining attentional engagement</b>, which will be reflected in reduced EEG power changes over time within blocks.",procedure:"Participants are placed in a <b>quiet environment</b> and fitted with <b>EEG acquisition hardware</b>. Each block consists of <b>multiple trials</b> of the same motor imagery task (e.g., right-hand grasping). A <b>fixation cross</b> is presented, followed by a <b>visual instruction cue</b>. The participant performs <b>kinesthetic imagination</b> of the specified movement for <b>4 to 6 seconds</b>, followed by a rest period. After completing all trials in a block, a new class is introduced. The order of blocks is counterbalanced or fixed depending on the research design.",requirements:"This experiment requires a <b>modern browser</b> capable of high-precision timing and <b>visual stimulus rendering</b>. EEG setups must support <b>multi-class labeling</b> and <b>continuous acquisition</b>. Integration with hardware must occur via <b>WebUSB</b>, <b>serial</b>, or <b>network</b> protocols. Participants should be instructed in <b>motor imagery techniques</b> and allowed time for practice before the session. <b>Optional feedback or breaks</b> between blocks can be implemented to prevent mental fatigue.",characteristics:"This task is <b>endogenous</b>, driven by internal intention rather than external triggers. It employs a <b>blocked design</b> to minimize cognitive switching and maximize signal repeatability, making it especially useful for <b>model calibration</b> and <b>early-stage BCI training</b> where signal reliability is critical."};stimulusCommandMap={Right:"r",Left:"l",Up:"u",Down:"d",Rest:"s"};formField=[{type:"checkbox",key:"classes",label:"Motor Imagery Classes",value:["Right","Left"],options:["Right","Left","Up","Down","Rest"],hint:"Select the classes to include in the experiment."},{type:"slider",key:"trials_per_class",label:"Trials per Class",value:20,min:1,max:100,step:1,suffix:" trials",hint:"Number of repetitions per selected class."},{type:"slider",key:"stimulus_duration",label:"Stimulus Duration",value:4e3,min:100,max:1e4,step:100,suffix:" ms",hint:"Time each stimulus is shown."},{type:"range",key:"soa",label:"SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony)",value:[1e3,2e3],min:0,max:5e3,step:100,suffix:" ms",hint:"Time between stimuli, randomized between min and max."}];static \u0275fac=function(i){return new(i||h)(l(E),l(B),l(j),l(U),l(q),l(L),l(V))};static \u0275cmp=k({type:h,selectors:[["app-blocked"]],features:[M],decls:36,vars:20,consts:[["taskPanel",""],["tabGroup",""],["formComponent",""],[1,"no-margin-bottom"],[1,"align-justify",3,"innerHTML"],["dynamicHeight","","mat-stretch-tabs","",1,"example-stretched-tabs","mat-elevation-z4"],["label","Stimuli Delivery"],[1,"margin-bottom-small"],[3,"valueChange","config","columns","storageKey"],[1,"margin-top-large",3,"innerHTML"],[1,"flex-row","flex-row-left"],[1,"elipsis-96",3,"href"],["matIconButton","",3,"cdkCopyToClipboard"],["matButton","filled",1,"margin-top-large","margin-bottom-large",3,"click"],[3,"commandRegistry","experimentConfig","embeded","stimulusCommandMap"],["label","Markers Generation"],[1,"margin-top-large"],[3,"stimulusCommandMap"],["label","Neurofeedback & Runtime Events"],[3,"commandRegistryMap","stimulusCommandMap","hardwareIP"],["label","Experiment Context"],[3,"experiment"],["matFab","","extended","",1,"margin-top-large","button-configure","margin-bottom-medium","margin-left-small","mat-elevation-z1",3,"click"]],template:function(i,e){if(i&1){let m=w();a(0,"div",null,0)(2,"h1",3),c(3),o(),p(4,"p",4),a(5,"mat-tab-group",5,1)(7,"mat-tab",6),p(8,"div",7),a(9,"app-inputs",8,2),g("valueChange",function(s){return u(m),b(e.onFormValueChange(s))}),o(),p(11,"div",9),a(12,"p",10)(13,"span")(14,"b"),c(15,"Direct experiment link:"),o()(),a(16,"a",11),c(17),o(),a(18,"button",12)(19,"mat-icon"),c(20,"content_copy"),o()()(),a(21,"button",13),g("click",function(){return u(m),b(e.loadDefaultValues())}),c(22,"Load Default Values"),o(),a(23,"app-stimuli",14),g("commandRegistry",function(s){return u(m),b(e.setCommandRegistry(s))}),o()(),a(24,"mat-tab",15),p(25,"div",16)(26,"app-markers",17),o(),a(27,"mat-tab",18),p(28,"app-layout-commands",19),o(),a(29,"mat-tab",20),p(30,"div",16)(31,"app-context",21),a(32,"button",22),g("click",function(){u(m);let s=C(6);return b(s.selectedIndex=1)}),a(33,"mat-icon"),c(34,"build"),o(),c(35," Configure this experiment "),o()()()()}i&2&&(r(3),S(e.experiment.name),r(),n("innerHTML",e.experiment.description,f),r(5),n("config",e.formField)("columns",e.columns)("storageKey",e.storageKey),r(2),n("innerHTML",e.summary(),f),r(5),n("href",T("",e.currentUrl,"",e.getFullWindowLink("/stimuli")),v),r(),_(" ",e.currentUrl,"",e.getFullWindowLink("/stimuli")," "),r(),n("cdkCopyToClipboard",e.currentUrl+e.getFullWindowLink("/stimuli")),r(5),n("experimentConfig",e.formData())("embeded","embeded")("stimulusCommandMap",e.stimulusCommandMap),r(3),n("stimulusCommandMap",e.stimulusCommandMap),r(2),n("commandRegistryMap",e.commandRegistry)("stimulusCommandMap",e.stimulusCommandMap)("hardwareIP",e.hardwareService.hardwareIP()),r(3),n("experiment",e.experiment))},dependencies:[I,G,$,z,A,H,N,F,D,R,ee,K,W,Q,X,O,P,Y,Z],encapsulation:2})};export{te as MotorImageryBlocked};
